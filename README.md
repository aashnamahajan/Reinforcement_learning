Implementing reinforcement learning

Task  :

To build a reinforcement learning agent to navigate the classic 4x4 grid-world environment. The
agent will learn an optimal policy through Q-Learning which will allow it to take actions to reach a goal while
avoiding obstacles. To simplify the task, we will provide the working environment as well as a framework for
a learning agent. The environment and agent will be built to be compatible with OpenAI Gym environments.
